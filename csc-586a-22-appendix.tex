	\acro{LTI}{Linear Time-Invariant}
		Linear time-invariant theory comes from applied mathematics and has
		direct applications in NMR spectroscopy, seismology, circuits, signal
		processing, control theory, and other technical areas. It investigates
		the response of a linear and time-invariant system to an arbitrary
		input signal.
